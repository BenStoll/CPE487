Final Project Description

This section is about the Final Project Proposal which is due 3/2/23 at 11:59pm
1.  Using the Openleaf project, create a new "CPE 487 Final Project" project.
2.  In the manIntroduction.tex file add a brief description of each of your team members.
3.  Add a new chapter called manProjectDescription.tex and title the chapter as: "Project Description"
4.  Provide a final project description.  Provide as much detail as possible, including (in \section{} headings):
-  Description: A paragraph describing what you'd like to achieve.
-  Requirements: A list of requirements for your final project.  This can include business and/or user requirements.
-  Block Diagram: High level block diagrams of your project architecture, as you understand it at this time.
-  Risks: A list of risks and potential mitigation ideas.
-  Testing: Plans to use testing and test files for the testbench part of the simulation.

If we want to display the LaTeX document locally, use MikTeX, TeXnicc, and Sumatra PDF and then you can commit to the repo locally.
