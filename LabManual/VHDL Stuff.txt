The Architecture will be the xdc file which shows which ports are being utilized and what is being written to them. This also should be a little explaination of the xdc file.
The Data flow is how the code sends stuff (inputs and outputs of each file)what files are linked to other files and then where that data goes afterwards (outputs/pmods)
The Structural is how each file's modularity works as in what files are underneath what (See Vivado)
The Behavioral is how the overall circuit board works under specific inputs and what each input outputs.
